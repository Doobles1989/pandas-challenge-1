## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pandas-challenge-1.git
    ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies. You can use the `requirements.txt` file:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. After installing the dependencies, run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to explore the dataset and execute the data analysis steps.
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook pandas_challenge.ipynb
    ```

2. The script will analyze the e-commerce dataset, transforming it to answer key business questions such as:
    - Top clients by number of orders
    - Top product categories
    - Calculating total revenue, shipping prices, and profits

3. Once the analysis is complete, the resulting summary DataFrame will display key insights.

## Data

The dataset used in this project is a fictional dataset for an e-commerce company. It contains columns like `client_id`, `category`, `qty`, `unit_price`, `weight`, and others, which are processed to calculate totals and profits.
